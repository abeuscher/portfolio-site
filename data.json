There was no source control or modular approach to site builds. As a means to help our editors, we planned and built a central CMS as a data source. From here we exported data to our public facing sites, both those built internally and those sourced from third parties. We also added source control and continuous deploy, and adopted a modular approach to code building. In the course of this, we began hosting sites in AWS, migrating older properties from a less sophisticated server environment. After growing our team I was promoted to a senior position. By the end of my time at 2K, most work was being done in house, with a greatly improved content editing workflow.",
