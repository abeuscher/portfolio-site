I was able to reduce page load time from an avergae of 14s per page to a more reasonable 2.5s per page, and also to export the site header and footer via js injection to our third party properties, thus maintaining visual cotinuity between our two third party providers (MArketo and Uberflip) as well as syntactic continuity in the header and footer space.",
